# minimal-Linux-with-busybox
minimal (bootable) Linux with busybox, for both qemu and real machine.

To build a bootable linux system from, the linux kernel and a root file system is needed in minimal. So in this guide, we first build a linux kernel, and then build a static linked busybox and finally create a bootable linux system.

## Build Linux kernel from source
First, download linux kernel source code from [kernel.org](https://kernel.org/) or use github mirror. In this guide, we select version 5.15 as an example.
```shell
wget https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.15.tar.xz
```
Then unzip xz archive:
```shell
tar -xvf linux-5.15.tar.xz
cd linux-5.15
```
Now you can create default build config:
```shell
make defconfig
```
We can simply use this default config generated by defconfig, if you want change config file to enable or disable some features, DO NOT directlt edit .config file, you can use menuconfig to edit it through a TUI.
```shell
make menuconfig
```
Finally we can start to compile the kernel. You can set max parallel process number by -j flag.
```shell
make -j8 # or use make -j$(nproc) to enable all cores.
```
After build process, you can find kernel image in the following path:
```shell
arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage # replace x86_64 to your system architecture.
```
